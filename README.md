# Algorythimcs
This repository contains many popular algorithms implemenation. Starting from simple sorting algorithms up to more advanced graphs algorithms.  
It is very possible that yet this repository is not very populated with code. This is because I write those algorithms in my free time, so this is rather long term project.

## Book
For learning algorithmics i use *Introduction to Algorithms 4th Edition* published by MIT Press. This repository is for educational purposes, but if you wish
you can use this code freely, or check it if you struggle with your own implementation.

## How long it will take me to implement all those algorithms?
I don't know. My guess is 1 year. I as said i program those in my free time.
